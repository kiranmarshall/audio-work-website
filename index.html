        <h2>I'm Kiran, a UK-based sound mixer and editor.</h2>
        <p>I have been working in audio post production for about 8 years, and have been 
          fortunate enough to wiggle faders and cut sounds for some of the biggest shows in the world.<br>
          When I'm not wrangling audio, you can usually find me coding (I made this website from scratch!), studying Chinese, 
          or training Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu.<br><br>

      <div class="my-work-summary">
        <p>I started as a runner in 2012 at the <a href="https://www.molinare.co.uk/" target="_blank">former Hackenbacker Studios</a> (now Molinare) in Soho, London, home of shows such as Downton
          Abbey and Killing Eve. From making tea, I quickly graduated onto assisting lead mixer Nigel Heath, where I 
          gained much of my sonic nous. During this time I recieved my first Emmy nomination for my contribution to Carnival's hit show 
          Downton Abbey.<br>
          I lived in a land between analogue and digital, learning the old school principles
          of great sound, but utilising new technology and applying them in a new school environment to great effect.<br><br>
          After 3 years I decided to see what the freelance market had to offer, and was quickly connected with 
          Howard Bargroff, head of <a href="http://www.sonorouspost.com/" target="_blank">Sonorous Post</a>. For the following 4 years I freelanced for Howard and his associates 
          as a Mix Tech, Reversioning Mixer, Dialogue/FX/Foley editor, and onto being a lead mixer in my own right.<br><br>
          In 2019 I took a year long post with Howard, where I mixed my biggest work to date alongisde him, including
          Doctor Who Season 12, Alex Garland's Emmy-Nominated Devs, and the upcoming Tin Star Season 3.<br><br>
          I am currently freelancing once again, and am looking primarily for Dialogue, FX, or Music editing roles.<br></p>

              <p>Kiran and I worked together for over 5 years during the transition of Sonorous Post from a one man show 
                into a full sound post facility. The company would not have progressed to where it is today without his talent, passion 
                and dedicated hard work. His  skills whether he was mixing, editing, or just helping run the business 
                proved invaluable, and his dialogue editing skills were leant on through various projects time and time 
                again. He is a massive asset for any team and I cannot recommend him highly enough.</p>
